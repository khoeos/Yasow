I tried to write the docs as readable and simple as i can, but with all the thoughts and process i made for the app. I'm not a native english speaker, so if you see any mistake, please tell me. I haven't verify everything yest, and wrote almost everythings in one go.

So some notes about the project

1. I'm not a power user of obsidian, nor an advanced dev on next and typescript. I stared if for my personal use and to learn more about these technologies, I then decided to publish it following the encouragements.
2. I want to keep it simple, at least at the start, it's not my goal to compete with other big and more complete tools.
3. I'm open to any suggestions, but i can't promise to implement everything, especially if it's too complex or not in the spirit of the app.
4. The idea is to have a basic tool, if someone (or I) have a big idea that is outside the scope, i'll wait to have a stable version, and then probably go to expand the project somewhere else (with a fork or a specific branch)

I know there is pleny of other ways or alternative to host a obsidian vault, but as a quite junior developer, i wanted to try my own way to take a learning opportunity.

With that in mind, let's get stated, and even if it seems far for the goat, i take any ideas in count ! Whether it's on code, features or something else.
