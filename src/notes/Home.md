# Yasow

Yasow is a starter kit made with Next.js to easily put online notes or markdown content based on the operation and structure of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Yasow is in it's early stage, and some features are missing, some may bug, but it's already usable. Feel free to contribute to the project, or ask for features.

## Why Yasow

I've created Yasow because i wanted to put my notes online, and i wanted to keep the same structure and features as Obsidian. As a developped already having servers, i didn't want to use the official feature, and i wanted to have more control on the app over some other alternatives.

As a simple user, you can drag'n'drop your obsidian vault, put it on github and host it on Vercel, and you're done. You can now access your notes from anywhere. Yasow has some basic features and some more coming soon.

But if you are a developper, or know a little bit of code, that's where things start to be interesting, you can easily customize the app to fit your needs, and even add some features that you want. I want to keep Yasow quite simple.

## How to read the doc
I rarely made doc so feel free to improve them, and ask me if you have any question or modifications to made.

In the User section, you can find all the information you need to use the app, and keep use of the features without (almost) anything to code.

In the Developer section, you can find all the information you need to understand the code, and how to improve it, and some other things that may need some code to be done.
